# Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
You need `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Development server

Run `npm start`  and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Update

Run `npm run watch-css`. Now you can rename src/App.css to src/App.scss and run npm run watch-css. The watcher will find every Sass file in src subdirectories, and create a corresponding CSS file next to it, in our case overwriting src/App.css.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests.

## ALL Main Goals

All objectives have been met. You can add and remove productos (click on the add button to add and again to remove), such as add / remove the whishlist with the star button.
The pagination also works with all numbers.
